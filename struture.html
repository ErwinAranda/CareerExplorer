    <h1>The Structure Process</h1>

    <div class="Reason">
        <p>Starting off I was very confused on how to even apporach my structure because my goal is to convince
            <br>the user to make a website and show why it's useful to have one but I quite didn't know how too.<br>With whatver project you have in mind always
            figure out how your gonna structure it.<br> No website is just done without any thinking or design or structure
            I grabbed a piece of paper<br> and started outlining and writing gists of what I want my main page to be and the rest of my subsections.

        This was ultimately the final outcome that I made from my rough draft and wiredframe that you'll see the process for
        <br>When you start off a rough draft just put whatever you have in mind down and while your doing it, don't worry
        <br>about it looking nice because that's just the beginning step before your even close to finializing anything and 
        <br>What I mostly did for my first week was just brainstorm ideas 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Understanding Project</h1>
        <p>
            During the first week that I was suppose to start doing a rough draft I didn't know what my project would be about
            <br>And it took me a day to finally understand what I wanted and what my onjective would be for this project
            <br>that's one thing you gotta think off before starting a website, what are the reasons your creating one what
            <br>benefits are you giving to the user that will be on your website what should they expect to see on it too
            <br>all those are important factors before creating a website and even starting your rough draft
        </p>

            <img class="beginning_work" src="images/image0 (1).jpg" alt="draft">
            <p class="typing"> The way I did my simple rough draft was just by creating a box and started making a little design
                marking up where I'd make my navagation bar on the website and what information I'll put on the main page. I also
                wanted to make sure there was a contact me section at the bottom of my websites since whoever is on your website
                may try to reach out to you and if you have no contact information when your showcasing the things
                you do on your site with a resume, they won't know how to apporach you. I now had my rough draft done for 
                my main page but I knew that my subsections had to be unique to their page so i got another paper and started brainstorming 
            </p>

        <div class="first">
            <img class="sub_sections" src="images/subsections.jpg" alt="subsection">
            <p class="typing"> This image above was designed for my subsection called design
                and in here I wanted to at least have a good amount of screenshots that showed the user
                what my wiredframe would look like including the messages i'd have below them. To add on
                I kept it the same with my navagation placement and same with have my contact information
                at the bottom of my page, as usual don't worry about looks just make sure you know what 
                you want from you website, the structure,the functions of it. I made sure to do the same 
                with the rest of the subsections

        <h1>End of first week</h1>
        <p>
            By the end of the week I've already made my rough draft,brain storm my ideas 
            <br>and I've started watching some videos to remember the basics of HTML which stands
            <br>for HyperText Markup Language and the function of it is adding text and images to your website 
            <br>then you have CSS which is the whole design aspect to your website which stands for
            <br>Cascading Style Sheets and it'll be good to get some basic understanding of HTML & CSS
            <br>when creating your own website so then you can start drafting ideas
