    <h1>The Structure Process</h1>

    <div class="Reason">
        <p>Starting off I was very confused on how to even apporach my structure because my goal is to convince
            <br>you as the user to make a website but I quite didn't know how too. With whatver project you have in mind always
            <br>figure out how your gonna structure it. No website is just done without any thinking or design or structure
            <br>I grabbed a piece of paper and started outlining and writing te gist of what I want my main page to be which
            <br> ended up being the way it is now
        </p>

        <p>
        This was ultimately the final outcome and you'll see later on as you keep reading that I had this idea from
        <br> the beginning and even if your rough draft on wherever you did it, it doesn't have to look pleasing 
        <br>It's not the final product so don't beat yourself down if your rough draft isn't looking the best.
