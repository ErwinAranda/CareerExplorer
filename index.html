    <div class="The__Plan">
    <p>The way this website came to be was for my capstone project<br> This project's objective 
    is to demonstrate and motivate my audience as to why they
should make a website,<br>the goals alongside this would be to build a portfolio with the content being a
post or case study about how the site was made
    </p>
    <p><br>The basis of this website is broken into 5 sections including 
    what I wanna achieve myself while coding for this website<br>We were given a outline on what
our goals will be and how we will split the amount of work we do throughout <b>6 weeks</b></p>

    /* Week 1
        <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <div class="Week_1">      
        <p>To summarize the information I put in this outline I basically wrote out a gist of what I'll be working on.
<br>For the first week it was entirely about creating rough drafts and figuring out how I wanted the website to look<br>
    In additon to the People I'll be able to get in contact from my mentor to help me out or give tips/advice</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <div class="Week_2">
        <p>During this week I started to have more of an idea after creating rough drafts writing my ideas down
            <br>A quick thing you can do is grab a piece of paper and start creating boxes and writing small info on those
            <br>to show what your sections will be summarized about and write what you have in your head
        </p>
    </div>
    /*Week 3&4
    <h1>Week3&4</h1>
    <div class="Week__3_4">
        <p>On these weeks I thought if I'm going the way I am with the first week and second week that I planned out
            <br>than I should be starting to code by the third week and continue till fifth to ensure I have time to finsh my code
            <br> and I have time to revise anything that looks odd or any last minor changes 
        </p>
    </div>
    /*week 5&6
    <h1>Week 5&6</h1>
    <div class="Week__5_6">
        <p>Now the final weeks since I had to do a presentation for my website I wanted to finish anything I needed to
            <br>whether that be making sure my spelling is correct. After that I would be focus on creating slides for presentation day
