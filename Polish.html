        <h1>Final touches</h1>
        <p>After having my wireframe completed I knew now it was the time to start coding, quick things to know
            <br>is that you should know some basics of HTML and CSS because that's as far you need to go if you're
            <br>trying create a website that showcases your resume or other things that'll be beneficial to the preson
            <br>going through your website and if you wanna go a little more advance you can always add small functions
            <br>that make your website look more professional and cleaner looking which I'll be talking about as you see below
        </p>
        <div class="two_lanes">
            <div class="phone_gif">
                <img class="Nice_gif" src="images/Animated GIF-downsized_large (4).gif">
                <p>After finally creating my pages here are some things you might wanna consider adding,
                    In my examples and Tips subsections I added buttons that send the user to the website
                    I briely talked about incase they wanted to see it themselevs. For this there is 
                    quite a helpful code that makes life easier and that's being "button" a simple 
                    line of code that simply creates a button for you on the spot. On CSS you can customize how
                    you want your button to look like if you want a different color you can change it and you 
                    can even add a Hover function when you hover the button it tones to a darker shade to indicate their
                    about to press the button. In the same line of code you can even change the text of the word being 
                    "Here is the Link" and you can grab a URL you want and insert and boom have a nice button
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="phone_gif">
                <img class="Nice_gif" src="images/Animated GIF-downsized_large (3).gif">
                <p>Now this next function I was to show the user that they are on a subsection
                    which would clearly indicate they're on that section even if they hover over 
                    the words it's still highlighted. It was quite a simple thing to do that for me 
                    it took a bit just cause I was learning it myself. Making sure you have div that has
                    a class, and when you go into the css section make sure you call that class and make sure
                    you setup where it highlighted and each section should have their own special class that 
                    when it's clicked the color stays the same for being on that page and if you don't wanna
                    go that advance you can always have you classes set as just hover and make it change a color
                    when the user is hovering over the word 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <img class="height" src="images/Animated GIF-downsized_large (2).gif">   
        <p>
            Now when it comes to the mobile side of a website you wanna make sure it looks nice since now all websites
            <br>perform well on the mobile side and one thing I did was create a downscroll bar with the subsections 
            <br>on it and for this you'll need the bare minium of knowing javascript because it wasn't that overly but it was
            <br>challenging to an extend which is why I recommend you knowing some basics of javascript if your really trying
            <br>to full scale on creating a nice and well designed mobile responsive and if you have some troubles you can always
            <br>check my GitHub which is where I have posted all the code and updated always whenever I make minor edits and
            <br>that's probably something else you wanna learn how to save your code on GitHub that you can learn too
