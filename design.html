        <p>
            After the first 2 weeks of figuring out what I was gonna do and created my rough draft I finally decided
            <br>to start visualizing my website and to do that I needed to figure out where I'll create my temporary Visual
            <br>idea. A wireframe to put it simple is a illustration of a page's interface that focuses on prioritization of content,
            <br>and intended behaviors and seeing what kind of design you have to your website. As you can see below I have
            <br>created a wireframed and the first one being the top left which is my main page, I obviously kept it the same
            <br>format I did back in my rough draft just because I thought it was alright didn't look boring but it looked engaging
            <br> enough.You can always create your visualize website on google sides or in another program that could be pretty
            <br>benefiting to your style without having to worry about things, I continue to go with the same layout of my 
            <br>navagation bar and including my logo/name on the left side and started with either a header or question depending
            <br>on the subsection I was working on. The structure was gonna be mostly about my thought process which I'm still
            <br> discussing the examples and tips I planned on showing off other website designs and how no website has to be the
            <br>same and lastly my about was gonna be a bit more detailed but in the end I decided to keep it minmal.
