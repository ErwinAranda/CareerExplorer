        <h1>Do all websites have to be the same?</h1>

    <div class="Section_one">
        <p>The answer to that question is a <b>no</b>, no websites have to be the same, all websites are the way
        <br>you make it. You choose how you wanna create it you can be super creative like this website above where it's 
        <br> all glitchy, has that nice aesthetic to it. It has a nice structure to it as you can see and is fully supportive for mobile
        <br><b>Quick Tip #1</b>
        <br>When creating a website always make sure to look at the mobile side of your website because sometimes it
        <br>might look the same as it would on your computer/desktop
        </p>

    <div class="Section_two">
        <p>For an exmaple take a look at my mobile side of the website I already had an idea of what I was doing 
            <br>but I still had minor issues. One of the issues I had while trying to figure out how to make my website mobile
            <br>responsive was sizing.When I tried putting an image the image would break off the website so I had to resize
            <br>certain images and text and make sure my drop down animation fit well with my mobile side
            <br><b>Quick Tip #2</b>
            <br>If you use Studio Visual Code then here's a quick shortcut on how you can set your page already
            <br>on your keyboard press shift+!+Tab and it creates the basic setup incase you ever forget how to start your site

            <p class="image_description">As the image is shown your website doesn't need to look like mine or the one above but it is an exmaple of how you can structure your website or that topic it could be about because this website talks about the changes made on their wendy's website just like my website is about my experience in creating one and showing you the process of how it came to be.

            Your website can also just be a portfolio listing all the things you've done as this website clearly shows that a website can be filled with all your all achievements and jobsyou've done over the years and the best thing you get out of your website is that it'll never disppaear you can always update it so that when new people come on to your site, there will be new information.

            <h1>Quick tip #3</h1>
            <p>While your on you way to creating your own website, here is another useful piece of advice that I got told, and that's using the <br>inspect element option when your making your own website.There could probably be a line of code that would be useful<br> in your own way even possibily make changes to it and to get to that you right click on the website your on and scroll down till<br> you see inspect element and click on it and there should be the code side of the website and it'll highlight what code is exact to the page</p>
