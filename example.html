        <h1>Do all websites have to be the same?</h1>

    /*
    <div class="Section_one">
        <p>The answer to that question is a <b>no</b>, no websites have to be the same, all websites are the way
        <br>you make it. You choose how you wanna create it you can be super creative like this website above where it's 
        <br> all glitchy, has that nice aesthetic to it. It has a nice structure to it as you can see and is fully supportive for mobile
        <br><b>Quick Tip #1</b>
        <br>When creating a website always make sure to look at the mobile side of your website because sometimes it
        <br>might look the same as it would on your computer/desktop
        </p>
    </div>
    <center><img class="phone" src="/images/phone.PNG" alt="phone"></center>
    <div class="Section_two">
        <p>For an exmaple take a look at my mobile side of the website I already had an idea of what I was doing 
            <br>but I still had minor issues. One of the issues I had while trying to figure out how to make my website mobile
            <br>responsive was sizing.When I tried putting an image the image would break off the website so I had to resize
            <br>certain images and text and make sure my drop down animation fit well with my mobile side
            <br><b>Quick Tip #2</b>
            <br>If you use Studio Visual Code then here's a quick shortcut on how you can set your page already
            <br>on your keyboard press shift+!+Tab and it creates the basic setup incase you ever forget how to start your site
        </p>

        <img class="wendy" src="/images/Wendys.PNG" alt="wendy">
        <img class="paper" src="images/Personal.PNG" alt="Pro">
        <div class="Section_three">
            <p style="text-align: left;">As the image is shown your website doesn't need to look like mine 
            <br>or the one above but it is an exmaple of how you can structure your 
            <br>website or that topic it could be about because this website talks about 
            <br>the changes made on their wendy's website just like my website is about
            <br>my experience in creating one and showing you the process of how it
            <br>came to be.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Part_two">
            <p style="text-align: right;">
            Your website can also just be a portfolio listing all the things you've done
            <br>as this website clearly shows that a website can be filled with all your all
            <br>achievements and jobs you've done over the years and the best thing you get
            <br>out of your website is that it'll never disppaear you can always update it so
            <br>that when new people come on to your site, there will be new information.
